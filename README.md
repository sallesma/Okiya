Okiya
=====

Okiya is a Japanese game. The rules are available in French in the .pdf file at the root of this repo. They are also proably available on the web

The project was not versionned through git. I've put it here just in case anyone want to play with it/improve the code/have fun with prolog.

To run the game, use "jeu." in your prolog console.
